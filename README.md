# SuperGit

## Introduction
SuperGit is a Git clone that is going to be supercharged for productivity. 

## First Step: Make a basic Git clone
### Deadline: 5 Days
I need to make a working Git clone in the by Aug 5. The clone needs to have the following commands:
1. supergit init
2. supergit add <FILENAME>
3. supergit commit -m <COMMIT MESSAGE>
4. supergit push -u origin <BRANCH NAME>
5. supergit branch -b <BRANCH NAME>
6. supergit checkout <BRANCH NAME>
7. supergit clone <REPO URL>

The time constraint pushes me to make the UI as basic as possible. I will skip making a login page and instead rely on keys to make the connection secure. I will also skip extensive security to make the project possible.
